# Experiments

## To do

- _Voice over_
- _Closed captions_ (maybe spatially located at sound generator, maybe not)
- _Echo location_ (send out a pulse that is a ray, get back a sound based on length of the ray)
- _3D sound_ (e.g. just hearing the enemy tanks, not seeing them)
- _Music maker_ (e.g. shooting adds a tone/something to a simple sequencer)
- _John Cage + Tanks?_ (e.g. Tanks as a random music making instrument, the instrumented Tanks? Objects they can't see and bump into? Triggers they play?)
- _Microphone input_ (get it, use it)
- _Karaoke_ (sing-a-long with lyrics at the bottom?)
- _Computer voice_ (get it working? accessibility? screen reader?)

## 2018-01-07 21:52, in which I write myself about an idea in the bath about voice-over

I was thinking about this more generally at first: a game in which the soundtrack is audio of me narrating (in real time) the development of the game. So it would need to be a really small game, buildable in an hour say? And then the game itself would need to be able to last for an hour while you played it.

And this can clearly be applicable in the Sound edition of TANKS!ES, right? _Voice over_ is a sound. And even if this specific idea didn't work some kind of voice over is worth doing. Though I think this specific idea is powerful and interesting. Related, of course of course, to Foddy's _Getting Over It_ and also to the Syrian one, _Path Out_. But I think I could do something interestingly different? (Again, especially if it's this kind of real time thing, and so specifically related in a weird way to the actual game you're playing. Could even add addenda if I polish the game or make any little changes later on? Though try to keep to the idea of just an hour-ish and the whole thing is done?)

Probably it should be developed pretty late so that I have a maximum of Unity fluidity and don't fumble too much? Can I develop and narrate? Why, in the bath, did I imagine myself narrating in French?
