# Tanks!?

This is the process documentation wiki for the game *Tanks!?*. The process documentation presented here combines documentation from the two repositories I worked on the game in (first [tankses](https://github.com/pippinbarr/tankses) and then [tanks-exclamation-mark-question-mark](https://github.com/pippinbarr/tanks-exclamation-mark-question-mark)), each of which had its own documentation wiki. I've converted the wikis back to simple files.

### [Design Journal](./journal.md)
A journal that includes high-level reflections on the design and development process

### [Manifesto](./manifesto.md)
Attempts to codify what my point is

### Unity category-based experimental ideas
These are from early incarnations when the game was going to be a suite of minigames exploring distinct elements of the Unity game engine.
